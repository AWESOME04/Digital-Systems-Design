## Introduction

The multiplexer and demultiplexer are fundamental components in digital circuits that enable data routing and control. The multiplexer selects one input signal from multiple sources based on control signals, while the demultiplexer distributes a single input signal to multiple outputs based on control signals. This project provides VHDL implementations of these components and demonstrates their functionality through simulation.

## Features

- VHDL code for a 4-to-1 multiplexer and a 1-to-4 demultiplexer
- Simulated waveform analysis using ModelSim
- Truth table comparison to verify functionality
- Clear and well-commented code for easy understanding and modification

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com//vhdl-mux-demux.git](https://github.com/AWESOME04/Digital-Systems-Design.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Design and Simulation of a Multiplexer and Demultiplexer
   ```

3. Open the VHDL files in your preferred development environmen`t or simulation tool.

## Simulation and Verification

The simulation and verification process for the multiplexer and demultiplexer designs involve the following steps:

1. Compile the VHDL code to ensure there are no syntax errors.

2. Set up the simulation environment, including the input signals and simulation time.

3. Run the simulation and analyze the waveform output.

4. Compare the simulation results with the expected truth table values.
